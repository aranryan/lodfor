# aggregates, or converts, from monthly to quarterly
#
# I based this on the as.quarterly function that is in
# the tframePlus package
# I set it up so you have to give a type of aggregation
# it works for type=sum or type=mean
# The ts line is basically converting a series from xts
# to ts, because the ts works as an input to as.quarterly
# One reason that I believe I needed to set this up was
# that I want to be able to run it accross columns of an xts
# object, which one can't typically do with apply.
# also, the aggregate.zoo function will sum up the months
# to a quarterly value even if the last month is missing, for 
# example:
#tempc_m <- opcl_m$totusoprms
#tempc_q <- aggregate(tempc_m, as.yearqtr, sum)
#tempc_q <- xts(tempc_q)
# so this is what I came up with

    # series that start earlier than others. If I did TRUE, I think some were
    # being dropped, leading to errors when used in a vapply, where I had to 
    # specify the length of what would come back, as it wasn't the same for all
    # so I changed this to FALSE, and then in the vapply I used ceiling to round
    # to include the last quarter
    na.rm=FALSE)
