# convert to quarterly
# I couldn't use apply because the object is 
# a xts, not a dataframe, see 
# http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/39180/best-way-to-apply-across-an-xts-object

# sets up the start of the index that will be used for the quarterly object
# uses vapply to essentially run an apply across the xts object because
# apply doesn't work on an xts object
# for vapply we need to give the expected length in FUN.VALUE and a
# start date and quarterly frequency
# The function that I'm applying to each column is m_to_q, which I wrote, the type="sum"
# is giving the type of aggregation to use in it

# as a temp fix, I shortened a_mz to end at the end of a quarter. 
# I need to come up with a better fix. The issue was that the 
# function was expecting something length 111, but getting 112. 
# might be an issue because I changed na.rm to FALSE in the 
# m_to_q function because it was causing issues for the Mexico
# series that were different lengths. So I put that back to na.rm=TRUE and it worked
